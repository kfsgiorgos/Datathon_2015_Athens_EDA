# Datathon_2015_Athens_EDA
Together with my friend and former colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAAAUl3J0B2lgX_-eorAM4w8g-pnWOUK5hKKQ&authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=M1xH&locale=en_US&trk=tyah&trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2CclickedEntityId%3A86367389%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH%2Cidx%3A1-2-2%2CtarId%3A1444917774526%2Ctas%3Achrist">Christos - Iraklis Tsatsoulis</a>, we formed a team to participate to the Athens Datathon 2015, organized by ThinkBiz on October 3; the datathon took place at the premises of Skroutz.gr, which was also the major sponsor and the data provider.
This Ipython Notebook is the corresponding code that I wrote during Datathon and presents the same results as Iraklis produced with R and presented in his blog http://www.nodalpoint.com/athens-datathon-2015-exploratory-data-analysis-for-anomaly-detection-data-quality/
