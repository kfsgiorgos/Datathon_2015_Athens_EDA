# Datathon_2015_Athens_EDA
Together with my friend and former colleague Christos - Iraklis Tsatsoulis, we formed a team to participate to the Athens Datathon 2015, organized by ThinkBiz on October 3; the datathon took place at the premises of Skroutz.gr, which was also the major sponsor and the data provider.
This Ipython Notebook is the corresponding code that I wrote during Datathon and presents the same results as Iraklis produced with R and presented in his blog http://www.nodalpoint.com/tag/datathon-2015/
